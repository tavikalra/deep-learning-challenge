# deep-learning-challenge

This repository contains the code and documentation for a deep learning project focused on predicting the success of charities funded by Alphabet Soup. The goal is to build a binary classification model using a neural network (implemented in TensorFlow/Keras) that can accurately predict whether an organization will be successful based on various features provided in a CSV dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and optimization. Several iterations of model optimization are explored, culminating in a final, highly-tuned neural network model.  Although considerable effort was put into optimizing the neural network, it *did not* achieve the target accuracy of 75%. This reinforces the recommendation (made in the project report) to use a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree model (like XGBoost) for this type of task. *Note: While an XGBoost model is recommended, it is not implemented in this repository.*
